## What it's good at?

__Refinery is great for small business sites where the client needs to be able to update their website themselves__ without being bombarded with anything too complicated.

Unlike other content managers, Refinery is truly aimed at the end user making it easy for them to pick up and make changes themselves.

### For developers

* Allows you to get a small business site completed __ridiculously quickly__
* Easily __[Theme and customise](http://github.com/resolve/refinerycms/blob/master/vendor/plugins/themes/themes.md)__ the look to suit the business
* __[Extend with custom plugins](http://github.com/resolve/refinerycms/blob/master/vendor/plugins/refinery/plugins.md)__ to do anything Refinery doesn't do out of the box
* Sticks to __"the Rails way"__ as much as possible. We don't force you to learn new templating languages.
* Uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) for fast and concise JavaScript

## Requirements

Refinery's gem requirements are:

* [rails ~> 2.3.5](http://rubygems.org/gems/rails)

### Other dependancies

* [RMagick](http://github.com/rmagick/rmagick) - [Install docs](http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/install-faq.html) or for
Mac OS 10.5 or 10.6 users [this shell install script](http://github.com/maddox/magick-installer) will be easier.

## Installing and Setting Up Refinery

### 1. Get the Refinery code

#### Install the Gem

    gem install refinerycms
    refinery path/to/project

#### Or, clone Refinery's GIT repository

    git clone git://github.com/resolve/refinerycms.git mynewsite.com
    cd ./mynewsite.com
    git remote rm origin
    git remote add origin git@github.com:you/yournewsite.git
    mv ./config/database.yml.example ./config/database.yml

### 2. Configuration

Firstly, edit ``config/database.yml`` to reflect your database server details.

Next create your database and fill it with Refinery's default data:

    rake db:setup

After your database exists, you'll need to install the gems that Refinery depends on. You can do this by running:

    rake gems:install

As of version 0.9.6.21, the news engine was extracted into a separate gem. This is included by default in config/application.rb
If you don't want this engine on your site, just remove the config.gem line for it in config/application.rb
If you do want it, please run the following commands to get it up and running:

    script/generate news
    rake db:migrate

Now, news should be up and running.

### 3. Starting up your site

    ruby script/server

Now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and your Refinery site should be running.

You will be prompted to setup your first user.

## Setting Up on Heroku or Using S3 for Storage

If you're using [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) you will want to put

    Refinery.s3_backend = true

in your ``config/production.rb`` file to make Refinery store files uploaded on Amazon S3.

## Updating to the latest Refinery

### When using the gem

Simply run the command:

    refinery-update-core path/to/project/root/

and the up-to-date core files will be copied from the latest gem into your project.

### When using GIT

You can update by running these commands:

    git remote add refinerycms git://github.com/resolve/refinerycms.git
    git pull refinerycms master

This will pull in all of the updated files in the project and may result in some merge conflicts which you will need to resolve.
